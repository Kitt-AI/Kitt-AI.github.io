applicable Service Components, interact with the APIs.</p>

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><b>This Agreement includes important obligations

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">All parts of this Agreement apply to the
maximum extent permitted by law. A court may hold that you or KITT.AI cannot
enforce a part of this Agreement as written. If this happens, then you and KITT.AI
will replace that part with terms that most closely match the intent of the
part that KITT.AI cannot enforce. The rest of this Agreement will not change.
This is the entire Agreement between you and KITT.AI regarding your use of the
Service Components. It supersedes any prior contract or oral or written
statements regarding your use of the Service Components and any prior version
of the Agreement. Where the terms of this Agreement conflict with those of the

personal, nonexclusive, revocable, royalty-free right to use any Sample Data
solely within your organization to test the operation of the Service
Components, provided that you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend KITT.AI
and its suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorneys&rsquo;

  <p>The Service Components are being licensed, not sold. This Agreement does
not grant any ownership rights to you and gives you only a limited license to
use the Service Components during the term of the Agreement. The Services and
all related intellectual property rights, whether under copyright, trade secret,
patent, or trademark laws, are owned by KITT.AI and/or its licensors. KITT.AI
may pursue all legal remedies for use of the Service Components in violation of
this Agreement. No license is granted herein to resell, create derivative works,
reverse engineer, repackage, or modify the Services.
  </p>

  <p>KITT.AI may modify or discontinue any of its Service Components or the
related Service Components without notice. KITT.AI will provide notice of
material changes to the Service Components or changes to this Agreement by
posting such changes at KITT.AI's websites which shall be your sole notice of
such changes. You agree and acknowledge that you will periodically check the
websites to inform yourself of any such changes.
  </p>

  <p>In connection with the operation of the Service Components, KITT.AI
receives, utilizes, and analyzes communications sent to KITT.AI and any of your
stored records ("Submissions"). You retain ownership of your Submissions.
However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you hereby grant KITT.AI a
license to: (i) use and disclose your Submissions to provide the Service
Components; (ii) use your Submissions for KITT.AI's internal business purposes;
(iii) disclose your Submissions as may be required by law or legal process; and
(iv) otherwise use and disclose your Submissions in accordance with this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that KITT.AI is expressly
and irrevocably authorized to utilize, analyze, modify, reproduce, publish,
share, create derivative works of, or otherwise exercise all rights in your
Submissions and any analytics, statistics or other data related to or derived
from your Submissions and/or your use of the Services for any purpose, provided
that such data is in aggregate and anonymized form ("Aggregate Data"). Subject
to the records licenses, you acknowledge and agree that KITT.AI will exclusively
own all right, title, and interest in and to all Aggregate Data and other output
data generated by the KITT.AI Service Components. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, if you ever have any ownership interest in any Aggregate Data or
output data, you hereby assign to KITT.AI all such right, title, and interest
in and to such Aggregate Data and output data, including all intellectual
property rights therein. You also hereby grant each user of the Service
Components a non-exclusive license to access your Submissions in accordance
with your account settings through the Service Components, and to use,
reproduce, distribute, display and perform such records as permitted through
the functionality of the Service Components and under this Agreement.
  </p>

  <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><b>Section 27 - Payment</b></p>

  <p>The fees, if any, for using KITT.AI's Service Components are set forth on
KITT.AI's websites which may be modified by KITT.AI. Continued use of the
Service Components and the non-termination of your account with KITT.AI after
fee changes are posted to the website constitutes your acceptance of the prices
as modified. You agree to pay all fees fully and promptly.
  </p>

  <p>The fees, if any, for the Service Components must be paid in advance. The
credit card information provided to KITT.AI or a third party payment processor
to pay for the Service Components shall be automatically charged for the
Service Components upon renewal. In the event that KITT.AI or a third party
payment processor is unable to bill the credit card on file or you request that
KITT.AI not bill the credit card, you shall be solely responsible for any
renewal payment required. In the event that payment is not made, Service
Components may become unavailable to you and KITT.AI may terminate this
Agreement without notice to you.
  </p>

  <p>If any charges are rejected by your credit card issuer then KITT.AI may
deactivate your account until payment is successfully received. KITT.AI may
deactivate any account that has a disputed charge until KITT.AI, in its sole
discretion, determines the dispute resolved.
  </p>

  <p>You must provide KITT.AI notice of any billing problems or disputes within
sixty (60) days after they first appear on the statement you receive from your
bank, credit card company, or other billing company. Failure to notify KITT.AI
of the problem within the sixty (60) day period will result in your acceptance
of the charges and you waive the right to dispute such problems or
discrepancies. Failure to use your account will not be deemed a basis for
refusing to pay any charges. KITT.AI does not provide any refunds for any
Service Components.
